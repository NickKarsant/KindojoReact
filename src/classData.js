    title: 'Poi', privatePrice: 40, groupPrice: 20, description: 
    "Poi was first used as a traditional dance of Maori people of New Zealand to improve coordination, and strength, and has evolved to the international performance prop most commonly associated with fire spinning,or fire dancing. Although not necessarily the easiest to begin with, due to its ubiquitous presence poi is most often a person's introduction to the world of flow arts.", image: 'images/poi.jpg', videoLink: 'https://youtu.be/LN-DD9eegB8'

    title: 'Rope Dart', privatePrice: 40, groupPrice: 20, description: 
    "Originally an ancient Chinese weapon, the rope dart has not changed in thousands of years. With a weighted end attached to a 10-12 foot rope, this soft-prop is used to make complex empty knots around the body that can be quickly, and surprisingly, released as a shot that can extend the full length of the rope. While the actual prop has not changed since its inception, its varied use has evolved to include many different styles.", image: 'images/ropedart.jpg', videoLink: ['https://youtu.be/LN-DD9eegB8', 'https://youtu.be/vETp1DfmbI4']

    title: 'Dragon Staff', privatePrice: 40, groupPrice: 20, description: 
    `{Derived from another Chinese weapon, turned performance art, known as ${<a class="link" rel='noreferrer' href="https://youtu.be/RLtoH9NtY2I" target="_blank">fei-cha</a>}, or flying fork/trident, Dragon Staff is similar to Contact Staff but includes a rolling action, that significantly alters how the prop moves and is manipulated.  The constant rotation of the staff provides a stability in balance that makes it, arguably, more accessible to newcomers, while also providing sufficient complexity for advanced students to continue learning and exploring.}`, image: 'images/ropedart.jpg', videoLink: 'https://youtu.be/JqdTSEnAVeg'

    title: 'Contact Staff', privatePrice: 40, groupPrice: 20, description: 
    "Contact Staff refers to manipulating and balancing a staff on many different parts of the body limiting the use of hands to grip the staff. Many of the modern contact staff techniques come from baton twirling as well as the Chinese art of Fei-Cha. Contact Staff artists create remarkable visual effects since the staff movement seems so smooth and controlled while the performers movements remain subtle.", image: 'images/ropedart.jpg', videoLink: 'https://youtu.be/nlSZd9NQj0M'

    title:'Bullwhip', privatePrice: 40, groupPrice: 20, description: 'There are a number of variations of whips designed with different purposes in mind.

    title:'Nunchucks', privatePrice: 40, groupPrice: 20, description: 
    "Made popular by Bruce Lee and the Ninja Turtles, nunchucks, like rope dart, is a soft prop, or flexible weapon; fun to play with and infamously difficult to master. These classes will build upon abilities learned from the poi class, illustrating the differences, and teaching skills that favor exhibition and performances over weapon form.", image: 'images/poi.jpg', videoLink: 'https://youtu.be/ZRw-_a8mybs'

    title:'Introduction to Puppyhammer', privatePrice: 40, groupPrice: 20, description: 
    "The puppyhammer, another weapon-turned-performance-prop, is derived from a Chinese weapon known as meteor.  Meteors are characterized by a length of rope with an equal amount of weight at each end. Incorporating skills and movements from poi, rope dart, meteor, chain whip, and contact staff, puppyhammer is a unique mixture of props, offering a wide range of movements, tricks and unique combinations unrivaled by other flow props.", image: "images/puppyhammer.jpg", videoLink: 'https://youtu.be/Td4q2tuFmWE'

    `{Pronounced "seer", cyr wheel is an acrobatic circus apparatus designed by Daniel Cyr in 1996. 
    Utilizing centrifugal forces and balance, a performer is able to complete amazing 
    and beautiful acrobatic movements while riding this relatively recent addition 
    to the circus arts.  Many classes/hours will be spent working up to the basic
